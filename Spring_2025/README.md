# Utrecht University NLP Group Meeting: Spring 2025

Time: **11:00-12:00, Thursday**

Location: **BBG 5.45** (Buys Ballotgebouw, Princetonplein 5, 3584 CC Utrecht)

### Topics

We welcome different types of presentations relevant to NLP, including but not limited to:
- Original (ongoing or published) work from group members
- Interesting published papers, hopefully from top-tier conferences or journals
  (e.g. ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, TACL, EACL, ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, etc.)
- Overviews of interesting topics
  (e.g., trends in vision-language pre-training, techniques for efficient training of models, etc.)

Sometimes we also have research rounds, where we discuss ongoing work of group members.

### For Presenters

Generally we encourage the presenters to upload their slides and other materials
a few days ahead of the meeting,
so that the audience can already familiarize themselves with the topic.
